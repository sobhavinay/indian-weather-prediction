## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting key weather parameters in India — including `temperature_celsius`, `feels_like_celsius`, and `cloud` coverage — using machine learning models. It leverages a rich dataset from the Indian Weather Repository to train and evaluate a suite of regression algorithms.

## 🛠 Key Features

- Data preprocessing: cleaning, feature selection, and scaling
- Visual exploration with histograms, heatmaps, scatter plots
- Machine learning models: Linear, Ridge, Lasso, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost
- Evaluation using R², MSE, RMSE, MAE
- K-Fold Cross Validation for performance robustness

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Load dataset (`IndianWeatherRepository.csv`)
2. Clean and preprocess data
3. Visualize data relationships and trends
4. Split dataset into train/test sets
5. Scale features with StandardScaler
6. Train multiple regression models
7. Evaluate model accuracy and visualize predictions
